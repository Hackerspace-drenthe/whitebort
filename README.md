Whiteboard change detection and automatic upload
=====================

No documentation, figure it out or come back later :)


Based on excellent code from:
* [video streaming with Flask](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask) 
* [Flask Video Streaming Revisited](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/flask-video-streaming-revisited).
* https://santhalakshminarayana.github.io/blog/whiteboard-image-enhancement-opencv-python
  * which was based on: https://gist.github.com/lelandbatey/8677901
  * which was based on some gimp magic that someone found out. (dead link)

And a bunch of my own.
